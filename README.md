# ZEnchantmentCore

ZEnchantmentCore is a base API for building custom enchantments. It allows developers to create plugin addons relatively easily that function off of events. The heavy lifting is done for you -- building an enchantment addon only requires a few steps. Some of the main functionalities include:

* Creating custom enchantments triggered by various events (such as block breaking, dealing damage, taking damage, fishing, etc.)
* Customizable enchantment names show up in item description
* Enchantments work with vanilla Minecraft features, including loot generation, enchantment tables, and anvils.
* Uses a custom enchantment generator that can be customized in configuration
* Enchantments can be selectively disabled in configuration
* And more!

There is a sample addon, ZEnchantments-Basic, provided in the Useful Links section that has many different enchantments to test out. If you don't want to program your own implementing plugin or would rather save time, you can just use that plugin and have fun with it.
